## üîê API Key

This app uses [https://reqres.in](https://reqres.in) which now requires an API key.

### How to get one:
1. Go to [https://reqres.in/signup](https://reqres.in/signup)
2. Register to get a **free API key** (e.g. `reqres-free-v1`)

### How to use:
Open `src/app/services/user.service.ts`  
Replace the key here:

```ts
private readonly API_KEY = 'reqres-free-v1'; 
```

This will be used in all requests as:

```ts
headers: {
  'x-api-key': this.API_KEY
}
```
